This status is needed to complement the government’s effort to develop the national construction industry.
</p><p>On the international front, other then participating in international forum mentioned above, ACPM is considering whether to be a member of the International Project Management Institute (IPMA) with headquarters in Europe. However, the fundamental difference between ACPM and all the other project management institutes in other countries is the fact that the training conducted by CIDB is competency-based whereas the other organizations have adhered to the academic approach. ACPM may be the only organization that prescribe competency-based training for project management in the world.     
</p><p>The CIDB’s competency-based training programme for Certified Construction Manager is equivalent to a Masters Degree in the academic field. The entry requirements for the programme is a recognised degree in construction-related field. The recognition that the certification is at the post-graduate is further manifested by the training programme conducted by UTMSPACE and ACPM where the training materials are the modules for the  CCPM training programme and the Performance Assessment form part of the training programme. When qualified participants are awarded a Master Degree in Project Management by UTMSPACE and a Competency Certificate by CIDB. This is currently the only double certification programme in project management.
